## PDB structure feature extraction
Dihedral angles are used to specify the molecular conformation. Stereochemical arrangements corresponding to angles between 0° and ±90° are called syn (s), those corresponding to angles between ±90° and 180° anti (a).

In protein, polypeptide main chain dihedral angles: Phi (φ), Psi (ψ), and Omega (ω). 
With pdb_extractor.py, you can extract:
    - distance between residues
    - omega
    - theta
    - phi
